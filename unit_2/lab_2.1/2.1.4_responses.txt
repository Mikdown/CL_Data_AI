Q: (GPT-4.1)Refactor the entire analyzer.py script into a SalesAnalyzer class. 
The class should be initialized with a filename. It should have methods 
to load_data(), calculate_total_sales(), and find_top_product(). 
The script's main execution block should instantiate this class and use 
its methods to produce the same output as before. Add docstrings to the 
class and each method explaining their purpose.

A: (GPT4.1)The script has been refactored into a SalesAnalyzer class with methods for 
loading data, calculating total sales, and finding the top product. Each class 
and method now includes docstrings. The main execution block instantiates the 
class and produces the same output as before, with the addition of displaying 
the top-selling product.

Let me know if you want to test or further extend this class!

A: (Claude Haiku 4.5)Now I'll refactor analyzer.py into a SalesAnalyzer class:

Edited
analyzer.py+70-27
Done! I've refactored analyzer.py into a SalesAnalyzer class with:

__init__(filename) - Initializes with a CSV filename
load_data() - Loads sales data from the CSV file
calculate_total_sales() - Calculates total sales
find_top_product() - Finds the top-selling product by revenue
All methods include comprehensive docstrings. The main block now instantiates 
the class and produces the same output as before.
